# BEES - OBJECT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE

This exercise will not be the only factor in our recruitment process but provides an insight into your approach to
development work. Please think about how you would go about this exercise if you were given one hour to complete it.

## Scenario

Write an application with 30 bees that take random damage when a button is clicked. There are three types of bees. The
difference between the bee types is the amount of damage they can sustain before they die.

## Part 1 - The Classes

Write classes to represent 3 different types of Bee - Worker, Queen and Drone.

Each Bee has a floating-point health property, which is not writable externally and upon creation is set to a value of 100.
 
Each Bee has a Damage() method that takes a single integer parameter that should be a value between 0 and 100. When this
method is called, the health of the bee is to be reduced by that percentage of their current health.

When a Worker has a health below 70% it cannot fly and therefore is pronounced Dead. When a Queen has a health below
20%, or a Drone below 50%, it is pronounced dead. This 'Dead' property should be readable from each Bee. When a Bee is
dead, no further health deductions should be recorded by the bee, although the Damage() method should still be invokable
without error.

## Part 2 - The Application

Your application should create a single list containing 10 instances of each type of Bee. It must support methods to
allow Damage() to be called for each Bee, and to return the health status of each bee, including whether it is alive or
not.

The user interface should show the current status of each bee and contain a button. When clicked, a different random
value between 0 and 80 should be selected for each bee and applied with a call to Damage(). After each click the health
status of the bees should be updated.
